```{r}

```

## Step 1: Read in the dataset `ages.csv`.

```{r}
# Code to read in the ages.csv data goes here! 
read_csv("ages.csv")
```

## Step 2: Read in the dataset `ages_tab.txt`

```{r}
# Code to read in the ages_tab.txt data goes here! 
read_tsv("ages_tab.txt")
```

## Step 3: Read in the dataset `ages_mystery.txt`

```{r}
# Code to read in the ages_mystery.txt data goes here! 
read_tsv("ages_mystery.txt")
```

## Step 4: Read in the dataset `ages.xlsx`

```{r}
# Code to read in the ages.xlsx data goes here! 
library(readxl) 
read_xlsx("ages.xlsx")
```

## Step 5: Both `read.csv` and `read.table` have an optional argument called `stringsAsFactors`. Figure out what this does.

## Step 6: Find a way to use `read_csv()` to read `ages.csv` with the variable "Name" as a factor and "Age" as a character.

```{r}
# Code to read in the ages.csv with "Name" as a factor and "Age" as a character goes here! 


```
